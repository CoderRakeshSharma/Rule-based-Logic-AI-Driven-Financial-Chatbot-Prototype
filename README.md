# üí∞ Rule-Based Logic AI-Driven Financial Chatbot Prototype

## üß† What Is This?

This project is like building a smart robot friend who can talk to you about money. It uses special rules and a bit of artificial intelligence (AI) to answer questions about finance, like saving money or understanding bank terms.

## üõ†Ô∏è What's Inside?

The project has two main parts:

1. **Task 1: Data Extraction and Initial Analysis**
   - Imagine collecting lots of information from books and websites about money.
   - This part gathers that information and looks at it to find useful patterns.

2. **Task 2: Developing an AI-Driven Financial Chatbot Prototype**
   - This is where we teach our robot friend to talk!
   - Using the information from Task 1, we create a chatbot that can answer questions about finance.

## üìÅ Files in the Project

- `Task 1_ Data Extraction and Initial Analysis.ipynb`: A notebook that shows how we collected and studied financial information.
- `Task 2_ Developing a AI driven Financial Chatbot Prototype.ipynb`: A notebook that shows how we built the chatbot using the information we gathered.
